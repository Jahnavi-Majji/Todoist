## Todoist from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library

This application (a Todoist clone) was built using create-react-app as a base, and the technologies used were React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library. 

I've used SCSS to build this web application.

I followed Karl Hadwen tutorial on Youtube to build this application
